 You are a young programmer, fresh out of college, drawn to the allure of vintage computing. On a rainy afternoon, a thrift store visit uncovers an old desktop computer: a bulky tower with a dusty CRT monitor running *Zer0S*, an operating system long forgotten. Its nostalgic appearance belies a dark history, but curiosity drives you to take it home and boot it up.

As the familiar chime of the Zer0S startup rings out, it distorts into static. The desktop screen is unsettlingly barren—no icons, no programs, just the faint glow of the default wallpaper. The only files in sight are a cryptic "note.txt" and the corrupted "My Computer" icon. Initial exploration reveals broken windows, nonsensical error messages, and glitched interfaces. Attempts to reboot or repair the system only deepen the mystery, as new files appear without your input, their contents fragmented and haunting.

At first, it seems like an intriguing puzzle. The cryptic notes hint at a former owner, John Wayne, a programmer who vanished in 1996 under disturbing circumstances. The files you uncover suggest he became obsessed with *Zer0S*, attempting to unlock its hidden capabilities. But the deeper you dig, the more unsettling the discovery becomes. The operating system seems to have a will of its own, its corrupted data hiding secrets that feel alive.

The Zer0S’s influence grows with every interaction. Windows flicker, shadows shift in the corners of the screen, and distorted whispers bleed through the speakers, calling your name. Strange files appear, containing cryptic warnings and chilling fragments of memory. They hint at something sinister lurking within the machine—a malevolent force whose origins remain shrouded in mystery. Is this entity born of the system itself, or is it tied to the tragic events surrounding the computer’s last owner?

The boundaries between the digital and physical worlds begin to blur. Objects in your room distort into glitchy fragments, while memories resurface, twisted by the system’s probing questions. The notes, logs, and corrupted files suggest a dark force behind *Zer0S*, but its true nature remains elusive. Is it the remnant of a tortured soul, or has the computer itself become a beast, shaped by its own corruption?

Your mission becomes a desperate struggle to uncover the truth and escape the machine’s growing influence. But Zer0S is watching—taunting you, testing you. Every choice matters as you navigate a maze of haunted directories and impossible puzzles, each step drawing you closer to the heart of the system’s darkness.

Will you uncover the truth behind the Zer0S and escape, or will the beast behind the machine consume you, as it did those before you?
